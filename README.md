# RadialProfile3D

This is an ImageJ macro to obtain multicolor 3D radial intensity profiles around a pre-selected center.
Centers can be manually chosen or imported from a .txt file (tab dlimited, three columns: x y z, labels are up to the user).

 It was first  used in the paper Schmerl et al. 2020:
